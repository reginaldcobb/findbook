# Book Finder

I love old book, all types.   I have my favorites but I just love visiting local independent book stores in search of a rare find or just an interesting books for the moment.   Typically, I keep them for a bit and then I usually donate them back when finished for someone else to discover and enjoy.   One of the challenges of old book stores is the places are typically filled from floor to ceiling with books and it is very difficult to locate and find books.
